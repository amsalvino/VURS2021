Current products like this are usually either expensive, inaccurate or both. Additionally, they often lack feedback on position of the pitch over the Homeplate. Due to these limitations, customers are often dissatisfied with the smart backstop product they have purchased. Axiomatic design theory and concept-knowledge theory were used in the design of a new smart backstop product. Our team has come to a solution that can provide more accurate results for speed and position of a pitch and provide feedback in a clear and user-friendly manner.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21236&amp;authkey=AAr9191YEJJPIXA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
