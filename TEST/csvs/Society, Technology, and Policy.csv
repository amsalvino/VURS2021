OCs, commonly known as birth control pills, are known to have a wide range of side effects that are difficult to predict and address. These side effects are underresearched, causing a lack of knowledge for both patients and their healthcare providers. In this project, I investigated the factors behind this lack of research, developed a blueprint for future research by use of a survey that asked participants about their experiences with OCs, designed a tool that patients can use to troubleshoot side effects they experience with OCs, and encouraged further research into this topic.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21236&amp;authkey=AAr9191YEJJPIXA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"
