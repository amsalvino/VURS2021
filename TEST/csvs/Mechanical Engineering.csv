Glossectomy is a surgical procedure in which the tongue is removed mainly due to cancer and has affects on the eating and speaking of patients. Currently, tongue prosthetics are static and lack any functionality. Our project aimed to miniaturize the electrical components to fit within the oral cavity and move the prosthetic to aid with feeding. Magnetic actuation was explored and utilized as the method of movement.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21236&amp;authkey=AAr9191YEJJPIXA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

Researchers today are trying to develop a deeper understanding of their migration patterns and predatory habits to keep beaches safer for humans. This project partnered with MA Division of Fisheries and Dr. Greg Skomal, to create a tagging mechanism to attach a CATS Cam sensor system to the dorsal fin of a great white. The safety of the user and the shark were of utmost importance in the design process. Iterations of a pole design were modelled in CAD, fabricated and tested with 3D printed plastics, and manufactured with machining equipment. This project paves the way for further data collection on great whites, leading to more awareness and predictability of shark locations.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21236&amp;authkey=AAr9191YEJJPIXA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

As a result, structural fatigue accumulates at the site of the injury. This kind of injury is common in athletes, accounting for 10% of orthopedic injuries. This study examined how human metatarsals may react under repeated mechanical loading using avian bones. To achieve this, a design and test fixture were developed to model the physiological conditions and loading in the metatarsals. Subject testing of avian bones were used to calculate damage accumulation after up to 30,000 cycles. This damage was used to identify the mechanical properties of bone under cyclic loading, informing preventative methods and treatment for bone stress injuries in humans.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21236&amp;authkey=AAr9191YEJJPIXA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

This project explored various ways of actuating her two missing digits (index and thumb), resulting in the movement of her index finger being coupled to that of her middle finger, and the movement of the thumb controlled through pressure sensors which rest atop her metacarpal.

Sticking between the die and powder has a highly detrimental effect during an automated manufacturing process. Powder residue could eventually ruin a part, thus stopping the entire process to fix the issue. Of the multitude of possible factors, several key ones were chosen for further study. These included the die temperature, the binder composition, and the number of parts created before cleaning the die. If changing these factors is significant enough, new standards for determining and preventing stickiness in the dies can be created, allowing for more complex parts, higher efficiency, and less rejection of defective parts, among other benefits.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21236&amp;authkey=AAr9191YEJJPIXA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

Here we explored the self-organization of the active fluid confined in a water-in-oil droplet. We found that the fluid developed intra-droplet circulatory flows when the droplet was compressed into a cylinder-like shape. When the droplet was compressed further into pancake-like shape, the circulatory flow was suppressed. Inspired by this result, we invented a device that controlled the compression magnitude, enabling us to turn on and off the circulatory flow in real time. This work paves the path to developing an active fluid-powered machine whose power is manually tuned like a gas pedal of a car.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21508&amp;authkey=ABHaRM_lw8IYqAE&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"
