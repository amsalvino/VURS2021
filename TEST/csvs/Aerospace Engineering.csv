The goal of this project was to design, build, and test an MAV that carried a payload of 55 grams in order to compete in the 2021 WPI MAV Competition. The competition scoring equation rewards small MAV size, long flight times, and the ability to make on-board inertial measurements. The design process involved four subgroups focused on aerodynamics, propulsion, stability, and structures. The final aircraft was constructed using foam, with a maximum length of 55cm and a mass of 400 grams excluding the 55 gram payload. This MAV was able to fly for the maximum allowed time of four minutes while taking nine inertial measurements.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21236&amp;authkey=AAr9191YEJJPIXA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"
